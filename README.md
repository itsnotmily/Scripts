# Snippets

All code snippets I share here are intended to be used in the developer console of your browser. 
This is usually done by pressing F12 or CTRL+Shift+I, finding the console tab, copying the code you want from this page and pasting it on the developers console.


## ScrollSkip
It allows the user to skip forward or backward in a video by 10 seconds, using the scroll wheel on the mouse.
It should work on any html5 video player, such as youtube, twitch, netflix etc.
