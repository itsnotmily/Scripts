2. Press F12 or CTRL+Shift+I on your keyboard
3. Navigate to the console tab
4. Paste the code in the developers console.


## 🖱️ ScrollSkip
This allows the user to skip forward or backward in a video by 10 seconds, using the scroll wheel on the mouse.
It should work on any html5 video player, such as youtube, twitch, netflix etc.

Press \` (button left of 1 on the keyboard) to make the scrollbar disappear and prevent you from scrolling the page by mistake, press it again to make it reappear.
