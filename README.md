# Snippets

All code snippets I share here are intended to be used in the developer console of your browser. 

These have been created for Firefox but should work with Google Chrome also.

### How to use:
1. Copy the code you like from this page
2. Press F12 or CTRL+Shift+I on your keyboard
3. Navigate to the console tab
4. Paste the code in the developers console.


## ScrollSkip
It allows the user to skip forward or backward in a video by 10 seconds, using the scroll wheel on the mouse.
It should work on any html5 video player, such as youtube, twitch, netflix etc.

## NetflixTime ![alt text](../master/Media/netflix-logo.png "Logo Title Text 1")
Ever get annoyed that Netflix only shows the video time remaining, rather than the current play time? 

This fixes it
